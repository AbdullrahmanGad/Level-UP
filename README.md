# The Final Project For DEPI
Introduction:
This project focuses on deploying a Java application using Docker and Kubernetes, with the primary aim of leveraging modern containerization and orchestration tools to achieve scalability, service isolation, and streamlined deployment processes.

Technologies Used:
Java (Spring Boot) for microservice development.
Docker for containerizing each service.
Kubernetes for managing and orchestrating the deployment.

Deployment Process:
Development: Java code is written for the three services.
Dockerization: Each service is packaged in its own Docker container with a dedicated Dockerfile.
Kubernetes Deployment: Services are deployed as pods managed by Kubernetes.
Scaling and Availability: Kubernetes handles scaling via replica sets to ensure high availability.

Argo CD Integration:
The deployment process is monitored and automated using Argo CD, which:
Implements a GitOps workflow for continuous delivery.
Simplifies tracking of configuration changes.
Provides real-time visibility into the deployment process.

Key Takeaways:
Docker ensures consistent runtime environments, enabling smooth transitions between development and production.
Kubernetes automates the deployment and scaling of microservices, simplifying management at scale.
The microservices architecture enhances modularity, flexibility, and maintainability.
